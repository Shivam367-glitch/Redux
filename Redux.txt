1)Store(Shop)--->holds the state of application.

2)Reducer(ShopKeeper)----->which handles the action and decides how to update the state.

3)Action(Customer)----->that describes what happened in the application.



Three Core Prinicples



1) application has only one state as a object

2) application can not update state directly(use action to update the state of the application)

3) Reducer response to that action  and update state according to that.....
	(reducer is that who bind action and state of application together)



Combine Reducer--->is used to combine multiple reducer like in our example(cakeReducer and iceCream


Immer--->is a libary used to update nested state easily.
